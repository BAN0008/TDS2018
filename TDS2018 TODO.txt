TDS2018 TODO:
	Fix Pathfinding:
		//NPCs not following path correctly because AStar.cpp is setting incorrect vx and vy values to the points in the path(I think)

		Point.vx/vy should contain the velocity needed to reach Point.x/y not to reach the next point

	Design a proper test map with MapEditor

	Start writing A.I for the NPCs
